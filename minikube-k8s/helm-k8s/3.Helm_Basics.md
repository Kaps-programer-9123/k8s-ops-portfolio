# **Step 3: Helm Basics 🚀**

Helm is like a **package manager for Kubernetes** (similar to `apt` for Ubuntu 🐧 or `brew` for macOS 🍎).
A **Helm Chart** is a bundle of YAML files 📦 that define how to deploy an application in Kubernetes.

---

### **3.1 Key Helm Concepts 🧠**

* **Chart** → The package (contains templates + default configs)
* **Release** → A deployed instance of a chart in a cluster
* **Repository** → A collection of charts (e.g., Bitnami, Artifact Hub)
* **Values.yaml** → File to store configuration overrides
* **Templates/** → Directory inside a chart with Kubernetes manifests

**Reference:** [Helm Official Docs – Introduction](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/)

---

### **3.2 Searching Charts 🔍**

Find charts available in your repos:

```bash
helm search repo nginx
helm search repo wordpress
```

Example results: `bitnami/nginx`, `bitnami/wordpress`.

---

### **3.3 Installing Your First Chart 🛠**

Example: Install NGINX

```bash
helm install my-nginx bitnami/nginx
```

* `my-nginx` → Release name (you choose)
* `bitnami/nginx` → Chart name from the repo

Check deployment:

```bash
helm list          # Shows all installed releases
kubectl get pods   # Shows running pods
kubectl get svc    # Shows services
```

---

### **3.4 Viewing & Managing Releases 📜**

* **Get detailed release info:**

```bash
helm status my-nginx
helm get values my-nginx
helm get manifest my-nginx
```

* **Upgrade a release (e.g., change service type):**

```bash
helm upgrade my-nginx bitnami/nginx --set service.type=NodePort
```

* **Uninstall a release:**

```bash
helm uninstall my-nginx
```

---

### **3.5 Chart Structure 🗂**

If you want to see what’s inside:

```bash
helm pull bitnami/nginx --untar
tree nginx
```

You’ll see:

```
nginx/
├── Chart.yaml        # Chart metadata
├── values.yaml       # Default configs
├── templates/        # K8s YAML templates
└── charts/           # Dependencies (if any)
```

---

### **3.6 Helm Release Lifecycle 🔄**

1. **Install** → Chart is rendered into YAML → Applied to Kubernetes → Becomes a release
2. **Upgrade** → Change values/templates → Reapply
3. **Rollback** → Return to previous version with one command
4. **Uninstall** → Delete all related Kubernetes resources

**Reference:** [Helm Rollback Documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_rollback/)

---

### **3.7 Dry Run & Debugging 🐛**

Before applying changes:

```bash
helm install my-nginx bitnami/nginx --dry-run --debug
```

This shows what would be created—**no changes applied**.

---

### **What You Learned in Step 3 ✅**

* How to **search, install, check, upgrade, uninstall charts**
* The **structure and lifecycle** of a Helm chart
* The difference between a **chart** (package) and a **release** (running app)

---

### **Next Step → Step 4: Customizing Helm Charts 🎨**

* Override configs (`--set` and `-f values.yaml`)
* Manage different environments (dev, staging, prod)
