:jobs
What it is: Runs a one-time task like a script or batch job ‚Äî not a long-running service.

Why it matters: Useful for things like cleaning data, generating reports, database migrations, etc.

What you do in k9s: Trigger, view output, or delete completed/failed jobs.

:cronjobs
What it is: Like Linux cron, this schedules recurring jobs (e.g., run every night at 1AM).

Why it matters: Automate periodic tasks (like backups, API calls, emails) inside your cluster.

What you do in k9s: Create or manage scheduled jobs.

or any other entity i need to look at

how i can manage this 

üîê :secrets ‚Äî Sensitive config (like passwords and API keys)
Same as ConfigMaps but encrypted (Base64). Use them for credentials and private tokens.

Kubernetes treats them differently and stores them more securely.

You can inject secrets into your pods via environment variables or files.

üîß Useful when:

You're connecting to a database, API, or cloud provider.

You want to keep sensitive information out of source code.

what extra functionality need to deploy with app so my api key can be store as secrate 

=========================================================================================================

üìÅ :pvc ‚Äî Storage your apps can write to
A PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) is how your app asks for disk space.

If your app needs to save files, like uploads or database data, it uses a PVC.

Kubernetes binds this claim to a physical disk (PersistentVolume).

üîß Useful when:

You're deploying apps like WordPress, PostgreSQL, or media services.

You want to keep data even if the pod restarts.

how i can use this to store my file outside kubernates and can be access though file system...? correct me if i am wrong

=========================================================================================================

:configmaps	Store configuration data (like .env files) as key-value pairs.	Helps you keep settings separate from code: e.g., ‚ÄúAPI_URL=...‚Äù or ‚ÄúENV=prod.‚Äù

tell me more on this how it can help if i create fast api service how i can delivered config map with it
